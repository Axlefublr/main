# "Documentation"

Check out Notes\Change notes.md for a rundown of that commit's changes, in a more palatable format than the actual commit message

Generally, the commit message is a concise explanation for the commit's changes, Change notes expand on that and explain the choices made along with, potentially, my personal thoughts about them

So, it's a way for you to look into my development process

# What is this repository for?

This is my main repository, for stuff I work on and use most

I have a few other repos with libraries / functions that I extract from here, meaning this is the place where you're gonna find the latest version, if you can find it

Whether you can is a different question, so the other repos are for "ease of find"

# Things to check out

Check out Lib\ for all of my libraries. The coolest ones are probably:

-  Tools
-  Global
-  Win

As you might have noticed, I like wordy commit messages

They are actually extracted from a markdown file (Notes\Change notes.md), so you can check that out to look at the changes I've made in a more readable way

Fwiw, I make markdown files for stuff that I learn, maybe some of the knowledge there will be of use to you (Studies\\)

# You _will_ get an error

This repository is _not_ "plug-and-play": if you try to clone it and run the main script (Main\Keys.ahk) without changing a bunch of stuff, you _will_ get an error

If you still want to, I recommend checking out Lib\Paths.ahk, since it's the library that takes care of the paths used in all of the scripts and some libraries
