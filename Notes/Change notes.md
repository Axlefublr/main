Using a different extension now, which includes almost everything I want without the need for me to butt in

Deleted MovingCompany(), because I don't need to backup my changes in the extension, at least for now

Deleted AhkPlusPlusUpdate(), because the changes (once again if I need to make them) will be different, and I would rather completely rewrite the function once I need to

Removed the entries for Synhigh and the Ahk++ extension in the paths library, since I'm not going to use them anymore
