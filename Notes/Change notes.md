Now instead of putting the transcript of the video into the description, it's in a repo, to which I leave a link

Meaning, the only changing part of the description is the top part, so I can just paste the changing bit at the top, leaving the rest to be a preset on youtube itself

And because of this, I don't need to keep the description in the raw file, I can instead just write it down in the description file itself

The "paste description" hotkey on youtube studio just grabs that file, so I don't need to change much of anything to make this change

Since now I don't have to reconstruct it every time, so it's a bit more organized that it was before, more efficient you could say

Now, all that CleanText() does is convert the editing file into a reading file, that's it
