Change notes for SynHigh

For repos that I commit myself, I don't need a change notes file, because I can do my thing and leave

But for SynHigh? I kinda never do it in one go, and it's a long process, in which I'm gonna forget what I've done vs what I want to do, so having change notes as a file is really useful

*Especially* because commits are going to be automatic. 

I can keep doing stuff in the directory, and then leave. When time comes to commit the main directory, the commit will go on synHigh as well.

No changes? No commits. Pretty good strategy imo
