# Show_SetLink():

You give it a string with the show and the link, in any order

If you only put in one thing, it will say so and stop executing

Then it differentiates what's the show name and what's its link by searching "https://"

If it specifically didn't find a link, will say so and stop executing

If everything is okay, updates the link property of the show

Deleted mouse fullscreen hotkeys, and miniscreen, now xbutton1 & media_stop only do emojis for discord

No need for a specific spotify close, because it's included in CloseButForSure()

I do still want to have vk scroll, but there's no need to check for down and winactive for it, since down will work regardless if vk isn't active

Indent right and left removed in vs code: I don't do it often enough to not just do it with the keyboard

No need for a discord scroll because escape works by itself, I can just learn to use it
