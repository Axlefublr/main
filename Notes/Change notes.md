The modifier used for the mouse is now capslock

If I don't use it like a modifier, it doesn't end up actually toggling the capslock, which is perfect

Can be used for more things on the mouse, since I tend to hold my left hand on the keyboard no matter what, and using that for the less used things might be pretty nice

The reason why browser back and forward aren't defaults, is to skip the bunch of checks they have to go through before actually doing the action, improving performance, since this is such a commonly used key. So, they are still remaps, but with capslock

Added CloseButForSure() for Davinci resolve

VideoUp() no longer overwrites extra ahktest files I use for videos, since I may not use them not only for videos

New video up, link to it now in linker
