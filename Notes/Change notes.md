Folding and unfolding feels far more like a one modifier type of action that going to last edit location is, so switching them up feels like it makes a lot of sense

I've done a few commits through the normal git method (not the change notes function thing), and I actually like it quite a lot!

So if it's something small, I just explain the run-down in the commit message (shortly)

But now I actually had more to say so I went ahead and did! I can use this place from time to time to elaborate on my decisions and thoughts and use this lowkey like a diary

The people who might be looking into my repo would have a nice way to follow my development process thoughts, and I get to lay the stress from being unprecise off my chest

The difficulty of developing something like an ahk project is the fact that you're not 100% sure what you want, and elaborating on your desires *really* helps understand how to build the process in a more healthy way
