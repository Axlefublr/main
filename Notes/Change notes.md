Double quotes to single quotes in runner

Formatting in paths

1.ahk and 2.ahk renamed to AhkTest2.ahk, AhkTest3.ahk

Clean text didn't take the manual part of description into account, fixed

Additional newlines in continuation sections made it take the indentation into account, making the description weird, fixed by using \`n\`n

Added hotkeys for hopping to prev and next git changes
