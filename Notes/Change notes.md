Yeah ik creating hotkeys in a library is a bad practice, but it's much nicer
maintainability-wise for me to have them here, rather than having that huge 
Scr App.ahk file which has all the app specific hotkeys
You can make the argument that I could make doubled files, one is the library, 
another is the hotkey definer, called almost the same thing
But I can make the argument that you won't have a use for me App libraries to begin with
