Slack runner command added

# GetDayFromWeekDay():

Doesn't continue after checking the next week, if your weekday doesn't exist

You'll get an Info() saying "No such weekday!" in that case

Shows the date of the *next* weekday, so if it's friday today and you specify friday, you'll get 2, and not 26

Both Monday and Mon work (full / shortened versions)
