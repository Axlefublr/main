Since I mainly play gamepad games nowadays, I don't think it's worth it adding game exes to a group and making them maintain themselves "automatically", because what I'm doing really is make them maintain themselves manually still

So for that reason, I'll instead just use my suspend hotkey for whenever I play m&kb games, and if I don't, I don't even need to change anything
