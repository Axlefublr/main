Show_SetLink() and episode rewritten with a new library

As before, if there's no object of the show, it gets created along with both properties, leaving one a false value (depending on whether I set the link or the episode first (I don't see why I'd set the episode first though (maybe if I came back to a show after not watching it for a while (well, the code is more stable that way anyway, I might as well))))

Then once the object exists, set link / episode just update their property

Show_GetShows() shows all the shows (lmao) I'm currently watching in a bunch of Infoss (the multiple of Infos() is Infoss (or Infoses (or Infosi)))
