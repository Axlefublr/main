# Automatic push after commit

Remember the setting that automatically pushed the commits and it only worked for the gui version of git?

Yeah well apparently it works now with the command too, so all my commits are pushed nicely, automatically

I have a sneaking suspicion that "Commit" and "Commit all" are differentiated, and the setting only applies to "Commit", but not "all"

After trying out the "commit and push" extension, I switched the hotkey for committing back, but now it's not "Commit all", and that's the reason it worked

# Future of change notes

It actually feels pretty good to commit changes straight away

One change - one commit, and I don't need to commit from somewhere specifically (from the change notes file), I can commit *right* after the change instead, which feels more speedy and productive

Better yet: a higher commit ratio, meaning I'll have more green dopamine github squares!

Probably the biggest advantage of more common commits lol

When you stockpile changes in a commit message, instead of separating them, it feels like you're doing less than you actually are

And the changes get more annoying to look at, because there's less granularity you can revert to

If you want to revert a function, it's likely just going to revert the whole function, and that's pretty bad because sometimes I just want to revert the latest change without having to ctrl+z a bunch of times

About this file: it will stay the same until I decide to write something new.

First a clear commit, then adding text. That way you can look at the file either through changes, or by looking at the actual file, and it's going to be fine
