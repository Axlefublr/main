# Terminal

New terminal app installed

Currently runacts with the runner

Path in paths

Planning to make a hotkey instead and delete the entries in the runner

WindowsApps was restricted at first, so I couldn't launch the terminal using ahk

Thankfully, I resolved that issue using some random powershell script, and now I have ownership of that folder and can do whatever with it

Also, I disabled the admin prompt, now all admin actions are executed automatically, with no need to select yes for the more risky options

Yes, I know, this is removing security. Oh well, it's slightly more comfortable, and I'd rather have comfortability over security

# AppsKey

Appskey with pg dn / up used to be app specific, but now it's global

This change was made to be able to use it in the terminal app, but also I'm so used to this hotkey that I'd rather be able to immediately use it wherever else I might want to

# IT Terminology

After watching Firebase's video, I've taken notes, and one of them is a picture in JsStudy

I think I'm actually fine with having pictures for markdown in a img folder right where it is, rather than having a global one

Let's not forget how much more organized that is, and I'm okay with a little bit of "trash" in my project. It's a personal project after all
