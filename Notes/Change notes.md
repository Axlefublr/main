## OBS

To launch obs programmatically, it needs to start in its folder, rather than just anywhere

I guess it uses some files and is programmed in this wacky way to make it easier in some other fashion

Well, that just means that I have to launch obs in that working directory

I first programmed it with my own tools, but turns out the Run function has the functionality itself, which is really neat

So, it's just a matter of adding a parameter in two functions, not a big deal

I liked how smoothly the process of fixing this issue of mine went

Installing obs again, setting it up, figuring out its limitations and going over them

All without worry or anxiety about it not working potentially

And would you look at that: now it does work!

Taking a good ass walk really makes a difference, that's for sure

I feel so calm and relaxed, implementing or experimenting with something new feels really easy

## Github

I had this issue that I was constantly checking github to see the status of my pull request.

The amount of times I opened the damn website is insane

Turns out, github has a mobile app, which is actually well polished and is good!

With a phone app, I can just receive the notifications on my phone and see the updates like that, much much better

Now I won't be polluted with the thoughts of creating my own email tracker (because yes, the mail notifications *also* don't work for me, for whatever reason, and have been for a long time now (how do you even formulate this sentence properly? english majors please pull request))

## Global variables

As any good programmer, I hate global variables. But to be fair, I can sometimes go to great lengths just to not use a global variable.

And example of that is my Links library, which is just a function that returns the value

I mean, I could just have a variable for that? What's the difference anyway?
