Single line and expression only functions in App.ahk switched to arrow functions

Single function function abstractions now use bind, since global variables are recognized by the extension

My new-found formatter will be taking over my formatting preferences from now on (can't figure out how to change its behavior)

While I can do some magic with the extension's regex, I've had my share of fun with that and now I'm moving towards comfortability > feature(ability).

I could implement object coloring, change the colors for built in methods, functions, properties, etc; Different highlighting for links, but that's something I have to maintain.

Yes, I used to have functions that did all of that for me automatically, but were still something to take care of, from time to time, or at the very least I thought about them.

Now I have the priviledge of using good software without the need to really change it, so I'll just make do with what I have, rather than going back to "maintain hell". I'm not being paid for that shit after all!

While highlighting properties over the object they're on looks goofy, it gets the job done of contrasting the start of the object and the end of it, also doing the job of separating functions with methods
