Coordgetter rewritten:

Now you immediately see all the possible coordinates visually

You have the option to click on either just the X coord, or the Y coord, or both of them with a space in between

Whatever you click on, get copied to your clipboard (not literally, but the actual value you need)

The thing you can click to get the coordinates formatted for use in controlclick is now more verbose: it literally says "ctrlclick formatting", explaining what the button will copy if you click on it

Since pixel is one value rathe than two, whether you click on the word or the value, the same thing will be copied to your clipboard

There are also hotkeys:
* Escape as usual to destroy the gui
* 1 for screen coords (both with a space)
* 2 for window coords
* 3 for client coords
* 4 for pixel
* 5 for controlclick formatting
