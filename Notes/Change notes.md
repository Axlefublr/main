Failed idea with Show_Delete(), because of the limitations of the library I'm using

I can now both use i and f as mouse hotkeys on youtube, depending where on the screen I pressed the hotkey

I'm beyond confused: one place requires point access, another - [] syntax, for pretty much the same situation, so I'm really not sure wtf is up with this

Paths, Links, and Runner entries for shows removed, since now they are handled by the Show_ functions
