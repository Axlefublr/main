entry in runner to just copy a link without pasting it, pasting no longer keeps the link in the clipboard

RunSpec_StringWrapper() converts a string where commands are separated by `; ` into an array with a `pause` at the end, and passes it into RunSpec()

Essentially, a terminal in the runner (for simple few commands I don't need to add upon)

uppercase allowed in runner now, although will still be not used for commands and etc, the runner will continue to be designed for lowercase use because it's cool!

Uppercase is useful, and is kinda required while working with folders that I had previously named

The current naming convention is word-word-word, used to be Word_Word_Word

kebab case is kinda scary to me, but it seems to be the common practice, so I'm gonna use that now

no JsTutorial() anymore
