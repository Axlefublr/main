Indending is back, because I realize I'm used to it and it isn't much of a performance issue

Clicking in the middle of the screen, in any app, with the XButtons are copy and paste

Ms & xb in the middle of the screen are cut and winpaste

xb & ms moved to ms & xb

The more specific vs code functions too, like deleting lines, commenting and indenting are on ms & xb

xb & ms does nothing (returns)
