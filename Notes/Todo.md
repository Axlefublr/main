Numbers as hotkeys for guis, rather than function keys

japanese in runner

# Anime

The function separations will be handled at the runner's level

## show link asdf jkl;

The separation of asdf and jk;l will be in the function itself, StrSplit() by the space

try to just set the link. if it works, also set the episode to 0 later

if it doesn't, create the object with the link in it, and the episode sets later

any whitespace after the second word is ignored

separation using regex

anything+ space https://[^ ]+

same safety now for this

## show ep asdf jkl;

Also in the function

# Morse code

make morse code more efficient: for loop of the chars in the map (all of the one character at once rather than switch every following char) 

and implement it back into runner

# Mouse

first get the active window, and go to its switch immidiately

no overly specific mouse actions to make stuff more efficient

Get the position of mouse specific things more efficiently, with math and shit

remove unnessesary mouse hotkeys

simplify / move some of them

# Snippets 

show shown as built in function when it's a method

Organize them in order and add more 

GetKeyState params

# Snake
Snake

The hotkey to disable it is the same as the one to enact it

You can kill the snake by clicking on it a lot
