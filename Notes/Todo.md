Numbers as hotkeys for guis, rather than function keys

japanese in runner

# Anime

The function separations will be handled at the runner's level

## show link asdf jkl;

The separation of asdf and jk;l will be in the function itself, StrSplit() by the space

try to just set the link. if it works, also set the episode to 0 later

if it doesn't, create the object with the link in it, and the episode sets later

any whitespace after the second word is ignored

separation using regex

anything+ space https://[^ ]+

same safety now for this

## show ep asdf jkl;

Also in the function

# Morse code

make morse code more efficient: for loop of the chars in the map (all of the one character at once rather than switch every following char) 

and implement it back into runner

# Snippets 

Organize them in order and add more 

# Snake

Snake

The hotkey to disable it is the same as the one to enact it

You can kill the snake by clicking on it a lot
