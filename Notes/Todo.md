## Weather gui

!Capslock hotkey now triggers `#!d` *and* the weather gui, which now only has the weather

On escape ***or*** Capslock & s, the gui is destroyed

No autoupdates because I don't keep the gui open ever

No wd and dw because there's a visual calendar to look at

Tries to activate the last window after destruction
