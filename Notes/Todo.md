# 

Numbers as hotkeys for guis, rather than function keys

japanese in runner

# Anime

The function separations will be handled at the runner's level

## show get asdf

✅ Show_Get() runlinks the link, that gets returned

✅ Safety of getting the show

✅ If the show doesn't have an episode, it will be set to zero (meaning one)

## show run asdf

Wrapper function for show get that tells you if there's something wrong with the link itself and it can't run it

## show link asdf jkl;

The separation of asdf and jk;l will be in the function itself, StrSplit() by the space

## show ep asdf jkl;

Also in the function

# Morse code

make morse code more efficient: for loop of the chars in the map (all of the one character at once rather than switch every following char) 

and implement it back into runner

# Mouse

first get the active window, and go to its switch immidiately

no overly specific mouse actions to make stuff more efficient

Get the position of mouse specific things more efficiently, with math and shit

remove unnessesary mouse hotkeys

simplify / move some of them

# Snippets 

Organize them in order and add more 

GetKeyState params

# Snake
Snake

The hotkey to disable it is the same as the one to enact it

You can kill the snake by clicking on it a lot
