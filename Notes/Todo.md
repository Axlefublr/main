Rewrite symlink creator in a function

# Youtube video links

links to main, not personal in descriptions

update repo links

# Apps

Telegram close closes the process too

No apps or close apps

WinApp is asynced

# Built-ins

Change the token for built in matches by adding "builtin" at the end of it

Test it: every single one of them should stay the default regardless

Check what happens if you don't set a color at all in settings

Make a pull request for that

# Workspace

Gui shows both wk in & out with numbers

For loop of the array returned by the functions that get them, with a static counter that does the thing only

The base path is passed, is Programming by default

> That default is not in the parameter: IsSet(path) ? Paths.%path% : "C:\Programming\" path

You can also add a workspace with Paths: `wka paths ` and then the key of the property to a folder

> That way you can use the vs code command for stuff you would only put in once or so, and the nicer runner command for stuff you potentially add enough to want to have a paths entry of

# Runner

What the runner actually can do is enclosed in its own function

On enter, the function object of it is executed

Before that, the runner gui is first hidden / minimized

After that, it's destroyed

> This will achieve better performance

There can be multiple runner instances at the same time, with logic similar to Info()
